## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
I feel that I should get 15 out of 20 points as all the tests passed and I got the majority of the lab to work but for some reason the words were not being displayed/drawn correctly. 
## Self-Reflection:
I need to look more into the module medias to become more familiar with the intricacies of JS.
### How long it took me to finish this?
